# Minecraft server plugins (and more!)
Made by the glorious me!

This repo is a collection of all the open source Minecraft server plugins I've made.

I've added docker and waterfall for super advanced server setups and BungeeCord/Waterfall plugin development.

I will be running this very same software stack of Waterfall - PaperMC - Docker on my actual server too. Both for added scurity and all the Docker goodness.

### cESS (CustomEssentials)
Found in cess submodule.

### noPermissions
Found in noperms submodule.

### EnderItems
Found in eitems submodule.

### EnderBow
Found in ebow submodule.
Obviously I made this beafore the EnderItems and I'm choosing to keep a copy of the OG code as there are quite a few tweaks and other differances to the implementation found in EnderItems.

### Magika

### ChestSort?

### Blank
This is just a super minimal boilerplate plugin with a dummy command.
